## 1. What is Text Analysis

**Text Analysis** (also known as *text mining* or part of *Natural Language Processing – NLP*) is the process of automatically extracting meaningful information, patterns, and structure from **unstructured human language**, such as emails, reviews, articles, reports, or chat messages.

In simple terms:  
It converts raw text into **organized, understandable, and actionable data** that machines can analyze and use.

### 1.1 What is text analysis?

Text analysis is the method of processing textual data to **understand its content, meaning, or intent**.  
It usually involves steps such as:

- **Cleaning** the text (removing noise like symbols, HTML, etc.)
- **Tokenizing** (splitting text into words or phrases)
- **Identifying meaning** (detecting entities, sentiment, topics, etc.)
- **Transforming into numbers** so machines can analyze it

It is a core part of modern AI systems, search engines, chatbots, and data analytics platforms.

### 1.2 Why you should do Text Analysis

Text analysis is used when you want to **automatically understand or organize large amounts of text**.

It is useful for:

- **Sentiment analysis** → Is the review positive or negative?
- **Email/spam detection** → Is this email safe or spam?
- **Customer feedback insights** → What are customers complaining about?
- **Document classification** → Automatically sorting reports or tickets
- **Extracting important information** → Names, locations, prices, dates

You use text analysis when the goal is to turn **human language** into **structured insights** that support automation, decision-making, or data-driven intelligence.
